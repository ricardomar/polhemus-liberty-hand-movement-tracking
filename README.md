# Polhemus Liberty hand movement tracking

## Description:

To implement a live demonstration of the capabilities of the Polhemus Liberty motion electromagnetic tracking system using a scenario related with dexterous manipulation tasks.



## Demonstration: 

Live demonstration of a subject performing dexterous manipulation of Rubik cube. A Polhemus Liberty sensor was attached to the Rubik cube. The rotation of the cube, acquired from the motion tracking sensor, is displayed live in a computer desktop.

The implementation of the 3D virtual avatar of the Rubik cube is described and available [here](https://github.com/rmartins-net/Instrumented-Rubik-cube-touch-data-visualization-tool). A video demonstration is presented next:

Some simple bottle displacement movements have also been performed. The bottle and the fingertips are instrumented with 6 Polhemus Liberty sensors. The motion data captured by the Polhemus Liberty tracker has been recorded and played offline using a small MATLAB code application integrating the importDatasetTB toolbox presented here. A video of the result is presented next:
